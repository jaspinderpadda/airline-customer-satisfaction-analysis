# ✈️ SkyScan: Decoding Airline Passenger Satisfaction with Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

In the dynamic world of aviation, understanding what keeps passengers satisfied is critical to survival. This project explores a rich dataset of over 100,000 airline passenger surveys to identify what drives satisfaction and builds predictive models to classify passenger experiences.

By combining robust data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, feature engineering, and ensemble machine learning models, our solution predicts customer satisfaction with **93% accuracy** — offering strategic insights for airlines to optimize services.
