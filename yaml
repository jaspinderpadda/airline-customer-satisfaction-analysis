## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Acquisition
- Source: [Kaggle Airline Satisfaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction)
- Size: 103,904 rows × 25 columns

### 🔹 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed nulls and irrelevant columns (`id`, `Arrival Delay`)
- Addressed multicollinearity and scaled features using **RobustScaler**

### 🔹 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified strong positive correlations between:
  - **Inflight Entertainment** & Satisfaction
  - **Type of Travel** (Business > Personal) & Satisfaction

### 🔹 4. Feature Engineering
- Created **“Delay Status”**: Categorized delay patterns
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality (18 ➝ 9 principal components)

### 🔹 5. Model Building
- Evaluated 8 ML models
- Applied K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV

### 🔹 6. Model Evaluation

| Model         | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Reg  | 87.32%   | 0.93    |
| KNN           | 91.57%   | 0.97    |
| **XGBoost**   | **93.39%** | **0.98** |
| Random Forest | 91.40%   | 0.97    |

🏆 **Best Model**: XGBoost — achieved top performance with minimal need for tuning.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Inflight Entertainment, Online Boarding, and Seat Comfort** are top satisfaction drivers.
- **Business travelers** show significantly higher satisfaction.
- **Delays (arrival + departure)** strongly affect dissatisfaction.
- Minimal gains from hyperparameter tuning → models are near optimal.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Upgrade Inflight Entertainment** to retain premium travelers.
2. **Optimize Online Booking** to enhance convenience.
3. **Prioritize Delay Communication** especially for personal travelers.
4. **Segment Marketing Efforts** by travel type and delay experience.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Deploy model as a **real-time web app**
- Perform deeper **PCA component interpretation**
- Integrate **deep learning models** for further accuracy boosts
